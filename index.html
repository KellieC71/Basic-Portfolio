            <p> I work for Disney Floral.  I delvier flower arrangements to guests staying at Disney Resorts
 as well as setting up in-room celebrations for birthdays,

            anniversaries, or any other celebration the guest could want.  I moved to Windermere from Chicagoland about two years ago.  I have to say I do love it here and do not miss the snow.  I do however, miss the Chicago Style Pizza. </p>
