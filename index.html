            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <img src="assets/images/me.jpg ">

            <p style="margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px; font-size: 2em;"> I am a self motivated and progress driven candidate with an extensive background. With a long standing record
                of initiative and innovation, I have developed and executed strategies which I believe will bring value to
                any company. Throughout the course of my career, I have honed my administrative abilities. I am an astute
                problem solver capable of prioritizing and managing complex projects with proficiency. In my previous roles,
                I exercised communication, guest communication skills and multi-tasking in contribution of team efforts and
                organizational improvements. I am open-minded and focused on new developments in my field. I have proven
                to be effective and motivational with proficiency in problem-soling and collaborative work. I enjoy brainstorming
                and coordinating efforts to achieve a common goal. When reviewing my resume, you might notice a gap in employment.
                My absence is due to my taking time to get a Computer Coding Certificate to advance my skill set and raising
                a family. My schooling experience has enhanced my talents in leadership, teamwork, determination, and prioritization
                as well as given me knowledge of HTML, CSS, Java, React and Laravel and in my role as a mother I have headed
                the fundraising committees at my childrenâ€™s school and as a result I have managed multiple schedules, solicited
                donations, advertised, trained others, enforced rules and provided around the clock care. I am now settled
                and prepared to get back into the workforce. I believe the knowledge I have gained in computer coding will
                also benefit your company. I am looking forward to gaining more hands-on experience and advancing my skill
                in a work environment.</p>
